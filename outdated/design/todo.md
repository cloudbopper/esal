TO DO
=====


This is an internal list of things to do and features to implement.  It
is less formal and at a lower level than the list of story ideas.  It is
less urgent than any issues (which are external).

The code may contain specific TODOs which be found by running this
command from the top of the source tree.

    grep -iR TODO esal/*


* add option to flatten to control depth
* sequence to bitmap by key
* sequence to feature vector given feature functions
* function to get index, value of nonzero items (sparsify)
